# ReactJS Web App with Laravel API

This is a sample web application built with **ReactJS** for the frontend and **Laravel** for the backend API. The app implements basic user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and log out with a secure session using **Laravel Sanctum** for API authentication.

## Features

  - A form that requires email and password for authentication.
  - Validates user credentials against the Laravel API.
  - Redirects to the homepage upon successful login.

  - Upon successful registration, the user can log in with the credentials they’ve just created.

- **Home Page**:
  - Displays a button for users to log out of the application.

### Backend (Laravel API)
