# ReactJS Web App with Laravel API

This is a sample web application built with **ReactJS** for the frontend and **Laravel** for the backend API. The app implements basic user authentication, allowing users to register, log in, and log out with a secure session using **Laravel Sanctum** for API authentication. The project also features a Christmas-themed homepage with a festive snow effect.

## Key Features

### Frontend (ReactJS)

- **Login Page**:
  - A form that requires the user’s email and password for authentication.
  - Validates user credentials against the Laravel API.
  - Redirects to the homepage upon successful login.

- **Register Page**:
  - A form that requires the user’s name, email, and password to create a new account.
  - Upon successful registration, the user can log in with the credentials they’ve just created.

- **Home Page**:
  - Displays a button for users to log out of the application.
  - Includes a festive **snow effect** to enhance the Christmas theme.
  - Responsive and styled with **TailwindCSS** for a clean and modern design.

  - Integrates with **Axios** to communicate with the Laravel API.

### Backend (Laravel API)
